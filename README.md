# urban-sound-classification
Sw project for the course of Statistical Methods for Machine Learning, Master Degree in Computer Science at Unimi, a.y 20/21 

## Task
Use TensorFlow 2 to train neural networks for the classification of sound events based on audio files from the UrbanSound8K dataset: it contains 8732 sound excerpts (<=4 seconds) of urban sounds labeled with 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.  
The dataset is provided with 10 predefined folds. Train the model on folds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and test it on folds: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10. Report the obtained average accuracy and standard deviation across the test folds. Experiment with different feature extraction methods, network architectures and training parameters documenting their influence of the final predictive performance.
